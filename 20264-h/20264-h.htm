<h2><a name="WAHNFRIED" id="WAHNFRIED"></a>WAHNFRIED</h2>

<p>I visited Bayreuth on the 24th of
July, 1883, and attended two
crowded performances of Wagner's
last work, <i>Parsifal</i>. In the morning
I went into the beautiful gardens of
the Neue Schloss. On either side of a
lake, upon which float a couple of swans
and innumerable water-lilies, the long
parklike avenue of trees are vocal with
wild doves, and the robin is heard in the
adjoining thickets. At my approach the
sweet song ceases abruptly, and the startled
bird flies out, scattering the pale
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>petals of the wild roses upon my path. I
follow a stream of people on foot, as they
move down the left-hand avenue in the
garden of the Neue Schloss, which adjoins
Wagner's own grounds.</p>

<p>Some are going&mdash;some are coming.
Presently I see an opening in the bushes
on my left; the path leads me to a clump
of evergreens. I follow it, and come suddenly
on the great composer's grave.
All about the green square mound the
trees are thick&mdash;laurel, fir, and yew.
The shades fall funereally across the immense
gray granite slab; but over the
dark foliage the sky is bright blue, and
straight in front of me, above the low
bushes, I can see the bow-windows of the
dead master's study&mdash;where I spent with
him one delightful evening in 1876.</p>

<p>I can see, too, the jet of water that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
loved playing high above the hedge of
evergreen. It lulls me with its sound.
"Wahnfried! Wahnfried!" it seems to
murmur. It was the word written above
the master's house&mdash;the word he most
loved&mdash;the word his tireless spirit most
believed in. How shall I render it?
"Dream-life! dream-life! Earth's illusion
of joy!"</p>

<p>Great spirit! thy dream-life here is
past, and, face to face with truth, "rapt
from the fickle and the frail," for thee
the illusion has vanished! Mayest thou
also know the fulness of joy in the unbroken
and serene activities of the eternal
Reality!</p>

<p>I visited the grave twice. There is
nothing written on the granite slab.
There were never present less than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
twenty persons, and a constant stream of
pilgrims kept coming and going.</p>

<p>One gentle token of the master's pitiful
and tender regard for the faithful
dumb animals he so loved lies but a few
feet off in the same garden, and not far
from his own grave.</p>

<p>Upon a mossy bank, surrounded with
evergreens, is a small marble slab, with
this inscription to his favorite dog:</p>

<p>"<i>Here lies in peace 'Wahnfried's'
faithful watcher and friend&mdash;the good
and beautiful Mark</i>" (der gute, sch&ouml;ne
Mark)!</p>

<p>I returned, too, to Wagner's tomb,
plucked a branch of the fir-tree that
waved above it, and went back to my
room to prepare myself by reading and
meditation for the great religious drama<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
which I was to witness at four o'clock in
the afternoon&mdash;Wagner's latest and highest
inspiration&mdash;the story of the sacred
brotherhood, the knights of San Graal&mdash;<i>Parsifal</i>!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="PARSIFAL" id="PARSIFAL"></a>PARSIFAL</h2>


<p>The blood of God!&mdash;mystic symbol
of divine life&mdash;"for the blood
is the life thereof." That is
the key-note of <i>Parsifal</i>, the Knight of
the Sangrail. Wine is the ready symbolical
vehicle&mdash;the material link between
the divine and the human life. In the
old religions, that heightened consciousness,
that intensity of feeling produced
by stimulant, was thought to be the very
entering in of the "god"&mdash;the union of
the divine and human spirit; and in the
Eleusinian mysteries, the "sesame," the
bread of Demeter, the earth mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and the "kykeon," or wine of Dionysos,
the vine god, were thus sacramental.</p>

<p>The passionate desire to approach and
mingle with Deity is the one mystic bond
common to all religions in all lands. It
is the "cry of the human;" it traverses
the ages, it exhausts many symbols and
transcends all forms.</p>

<p>To the Christian it is summed up in
the "Lord's Supper."</p>

<p>The medieval legend of the Sangrail
(real or royal blood) is the most poetic
and pathetic form of transubstantiation;
in it the gross materialism of the Roman
Mass almost ceases to be repulsive; it
possesses the true legendary power of
attraction and assimilation.</p>

<p>As the Knights of the Table Round,
with their holy vows, provided medieval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Chivalry with a center, so did the Lord's
table, with its Sangrail, provide medieval
Religion with its central attractive point.
And as all marvelous tales of knightly
heroism circled round King Arthur's
table, so did the great legends embodying
the Christian conceptions of sin, punishment,
and redemption circle round the
Sangrail and the sacrifice of the "Mass."</p>

<p>In the legends of <i>Parsifal</i> and <i>Lohengrin</i>
the knightly and religious elements
are welded together. This is enough.
We need approach <i>Parsifal</i> with no deep
knowledge of the various Sagas made use
of by Wagner in his drama. His disciples,
while most eager to trace its various
elements to their sources, are most
emphatic in declaring that the <i>Parsifal</i>
drama, so intimately true to the spirit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Roman Catholicism, is nevertheless a new
creation.</p>

<p>Joseph of Arimathea received in a crystal
cup the blood of Christ as it flowed
from the spear-wound made by the Roman
soldier. The cup and the spear
were committed to Titurel, who became
a holy knight and head of a sacred brotherhood
of knights. They dwelt in the
Visigoth Mountains of Southern Spain,
where, amid impenetrable forests, rose
the legendary palace of Montsalvat. Here
they guarded the sacred relics, issuing
forth at times from their palatial fortress,
like Lohengrin, to fight for innocence
and right, and always returning to renew
their youth and strength by the celestial
contemplation of the Sangrail, and by
occasional participation in the holy feast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Time and history count for very little
in these narratives. It was allowed, however,
that Titurel the Chief had grown
extremely aged, but it was not allowed
that he could die in the presence of the
Sangrail. He seemed to have been laid
in a kind of trance, resting in an open
tomb beneath the altar of the Grail; and
whenever the cup was uncovered his
voice might be heard joining in the celebration.
Meanwhile, Amfortas, his son,
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>Montsalvat, with its pure, contemplative,
but active brotherhood, and its mystic
cup, thus stands out as the poetic
symbol of all that is highest and best in
medieval Christianity.</p>

<p>The note of the wicked world&mdash;Magic
for Devotion&mdash;Sensuality for Worship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>breaks
in upon our vision, as the scene
changes from the Halls of Montsalvat to
Klingsor's palace. Klingsor, an impure
knight, who has been refused admittance
to the order of the "Sangrail," enters
into a compact with the powers of evil&mdash;by
magic acquires arts of diabolical fascination&mdash;fills
his palace and gardens
with enchantments, and wages bitter war
against the holy knights, with a view of
corrupting them, and ultimately, it may
be, of acquiring for himself the "Sangrail,"
in which all power is believed to
reside. Many knights have already succumbed
to the "insidious arts" of
Klingsor; but the tragical turning-point
of the <i>Parsifal</i> is that Amfortas, himself
the son of Titurel, the official guardian
of the Grail, in making war upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
magician, took with him the sacred spear,
and <i>lost</i> it to Klingsor.</p>

<p>It came about in this way. A woman
of unearthly loveliness won him in the enchanted
bowers adjoining the evil knight's
palace, and Klingsor, seizing the holy
spear, thrust it into Amfortas's side, inflicting
what seemed an incurable wound.
The brave knight, Gurnemanz, dragged
his master fainting from the garden, his
companions of the Sangrail covering
their retreat. But, returned to Montsalvat,
the unhappy king awakes only to
bewail his sin, the loss of the sacred
spear, and the ceaseless harrowing smart
of an incurable wound. But who is Parsifal?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The smell of pine woods in July! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
long avenue outside the city of Bayreuth,
that leads straight up the hill, crowned
by the Wagner Theater, a noble structure&mdash;architecturally
admirable&mdash;severe, simple,
but exactly adapted to its purpose.
I join the stream of pilgrims, some in
carriages, others on foot. As we approach,
a clear blast of trombones and
brass from the terrace in front of the grand
entrance plays out the Grail "motive."
It is the well-known signal&mdash;there is no
time to be lost. I enter at the prescribed
door, and find myself close to my appointed
place. Every one&mdash;such is the admirable
arrangement&mdash;seems to do likewise.
In a few minutes about one thousand
persons are seated without confusion.
The theater is darkened, the footlights
are lowered, the prelude begins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Act_I" id="Act_I"></a>Act I</h2>


<p>The waves of sound rise from the
shadowy gulf sunken between
the audience and the footlights.
Upon the sound ocean of "wind" the
"Take, eat," or "Love-feast" motive
floats. Presently the strings pierce
through it, the Spear motive follows, and
then, full of heavy pain, "Drink ye all of
this," followed by the famous Grail motive&mdash;an
old chorale also used by Mendelssohn
in the Reformation Symphony. Then
comes the noble Faith and Love theme.</p>

<p>As I sit in the low light, amid the silent
throng, and listen, I need no interpreter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>&mdash;I
am being placed in possession of the
emotional key-notes of the drama. Every
subject is first distinctly enunciated, and
then all are wondrously blended together.
There is the pain of sacrifice&mdash;the mental
agony, the bodily torture; there are the
alternate pauses of Sorrow and respite
from sorrow long drawn out, the sharp
ache of Sin, the glimpses of unhallowed
Joy, the strain of upward Endeavor, the
serene peace of Faith and Love, crowned
by the blessed Vision of the Grail. 'Tis
past. The prelude melts into the opening
recitative.</p>

<p>The eyes have now to play their part.
The curtain rises, the story begins. The
morning breaks slowly, the gray streaks
redden, a lovely summer landscape lies
bathed in primrose light. Under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
shadow of a noble tree, the aged knight.
Gurnemanz, has been resting with two
young attendants. From the neighboring
halls of Montsalvat the solemn <i>reveill&eacute;</i>&mdash;the
Grail motive&mdash;rings out, and all three
sink on their knees in prayer. The sun
bursts forth in splendor as the hymn rises
to mingle with the voices of universal
nature. The waves of sound well up and
fill the soul with unspeakable thankfulness
and praise.</p>

<p>The talk is of Amfortas, the king, and
of his incurable wound. A wild gallop,
a rush of sound&mdash;and a weird woman, with
streaming hair, springs toward the startled
group. She bears a phial with rare
balsam from the Arabian shores. It is
for the king's wound. Who is the wild
horsewoman? Kundry&mdash;strange crea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>tion&mdash;a
being doomed to wander, like
the Wandering Jew, the wild Huntsman,
or Flying Dutchman, always seeking a
deliverance she can not find&mdash;Kundry,
who, in ages gone by, met the Savior on
the road to Calvary and derided him.
Some say she was Herodias's daughter.
Now filled with remorse, yet weighted
with sinful longings, she serves by turns
the Knights of the Grail, then falls under
the spell of Klingsor, the evil knight
sorcerer, and, in the guise of an enchantress,
is compelled by him to seduce, if
possible, the Knights of the Grail.</p>

<p>Eternal symbol of the divided allegiance
of a woman's soul! She it was
who, under the sensual spell, as an incarnation
of loveliness, overcame Amfortas,
and she it is now who, in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
ardent quest for salvation, changed and
squalid in appearance, serves the Knights
of the Grail, and seeks to heal Amfortas's
wound!</p>

<p>No sooner has she delivered her balsam
to the faithful Gurnemanz, and thrown
herself exhausted upon the grass&mdash;where
she lies gnawing her hair morosely&mdash;than
a change in the sound atmosphere,
which never ceases to be generated
in the mystic orchestral gulf, presages
the approach of Amfortas.</p>

<p>He comes, borne on a litter, to his
morning bath in the shining lake hard
by. Sharp is the pain of the wound&mdash;weary
and hopeless is the king. Through
the Wound-motive comes the sweet woodland
music and the breath of the blessed
morning, fragrant with flowers and fresh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
with dew. It is one of those incomparable
bursts of woodland notes, full of
bird-song and the happy hum of insect
life and rustling of netted branches and
waving of long tasseled grass. I know
of nothing like it save the forest music in
<i>Siegfried</i>.</p>

<p>The sick king listens, and remembers
words of hope and comfort that fell from
a heavenly voice, what time the glory of
the Grail passed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Durch Mitleid wissend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Der reine Thor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harre sein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Den ich erkor."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Wait for my chosen one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guileless and innocent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity-enlightened.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They hand him the phial of balsam;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and presently, while the lovely forest
music again breaks forth, the king is
carried on to his bath, and Kundry,
Gurnemanz, and the two esquires hold
the stage.</p>

<p>As the old knight, who is a complete
repertory of facts connected with the
Grail tradition, unfolds to the esquires
the nature of the king's wound, the sorceries
of Klingsor, the hope of deliverance
from some unknown "guileless
one," a sudden cry breaks up the situation.</p>

<p>A white swan, pierced by an arrow,
flutters dying to the ground. It is the
swan beloved of the Grail brotherhood,
bird of fair omen, symbol of spotless
purity. The slayer is brought in between
two knights&mdash;a stalwart youth, fearless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
unabashed, while the death-music of the
swan, the slow distilling and stiffening of
its life-blood, is marvelously rendered by
the orchestra. Conviction of his fault
comes over the youth as he listens to the
reproaches of Gurnemanz. He hangs
his head ashamed and penitent, and at
last, with a sudden passion of remorse,
snaps his bow and flings it aside. The
swan is borne off, and Parsifal, the
"guileless one" (for he it is), with
Gurnemanz and Kundry&mdash;who rouses
herself and surveys Parsifal with strange,
almost savage curiosity&mdash;hold the stage.</p>

<p>In this scene Kundry tells the youth
more than he cares to hear about himself:
how his father, Gamuret, was a
great knight killed in battle; how his
mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Affliction),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
fearing a like fate for her son, brought
him up in the lonely forest; how he left
her to follow a troop of knights that he
met one day winding through the forest
glade, and being led on and on in pursuit
of them, never overtook them and never
returned to his mother, Heart's Affliction,
who died of grief. At this point the
frantic youth seizes Kundry by the throat
in an agony of rage and grief, but is held
back by Gurnemanz, till, worn out by
the violence of his emotion, he faints
away, and is gradually revived by
Kundry and Gurnemanz.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Kundry rises with a wild
look, like one under a spell. Her mood
of service is over. She staggers across
the stage&mdash;she can hardly keep awake.
"Sleep," she mutters, "I must sleep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&mdash;sleep!"
and falls down in one of those
long trances which apparently last for
months, or years, and form the transition
periods between her mood of Grail
service and the Klingsor slavery into
which she must next relapse in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>And is this the guileless one? This
wild youth who slays the fair swan&mdash;who
knows not his own name nor whence he
comes, nor whither he goes, nor what are
his destinies? The old knight eyes him
curiously&mdash;he will put him to the test.
This youth had seen the king pass once&mdash;he
had marked his pain. Was he
"enlightened by pity"? Is he the
appointed deliverer? The old knight
now invites him to the shrine of the
Grail. "What is the Grail?" asks the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
youth. Truly a guileless, innocent
one! yet a brave and pure knight,
since he has known no evil, and so
readily repents of a fault committed in
ignorance.</p>

<p>Gurnemanz is strangely drawn to him.
He shall see the Grail, and in the Holy
Palace, what time the mystic light
streams forth and the assembled knights
bow themselves in prayer, the voice which
comforted Amfortas shall speak to his
deliverer and bid him arise and heal the
king.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Gurnemanz and Parsifal have ceased
to speak. They stand in the glowing
light of the summer-land. The tide of
music rolls on continuously, but sounds
more strange and dreamy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Is it a cloud passing over the sky?
There seems to be a shuddering in the
branches&mdash;the light fades upon yonder
sunny woodlands&mdash;the foreground darkens
apace. The whole scene is moving,
but so slowly that it seems to change like
a dissolving view. I see the two figures
of Gurnemanz and Parsifal moving
through the trees&mdash;they are lost behind
yonder rock. They emerge farther off&mdash;higher
up. The air grows very dim;
the orchestra peals louder and louder. I
lose the two in the deepening twilight.
The forest is changing, the land is wild
and mountainous. Huge galleries and
arcades, rock-hewn, loom through the
dim forest; but all is growing dark. I
listen to the murmurs of the "Grail,"
the "Spear," the "Pain," the "Love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and Faith" motives&mdash;hollow murmurs,
confused, floating out of the depths of
lonely caves. Then I have a feeling of
void and darkness, and there comes a
sighing as of a soul swooning away in a
trance, and a vision of waste places and
wild caverns; and then through the confused
dream I hear the solemn boom of
mighty bells, only muffled. They keep
time as to some ghastly march. I strain
my eyes into the thick gloom before me.
Is it a rock, or forest, or palace?</p>

<p>As the light returns slowly, a hall of
more than Alhambralike splendor opens
before me. My eyes are riveted on the
shining pillars of variegated marble, the
tessellated pavements, the vaulted roof
glowing with gold and color; beyond,
arcades of agate columns, bathed in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
misty moonlight air, and lost in a bewildering
perspective of halls and corridors.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">PARSIFAL AND GURNEMANZ PASSING THROUGH THE RAVINE</p>
</div>

<p><br /><br />I hear the falling of distant water in
marble fonts; the large bells of Montsalvat
peal louder and louder, and to music
of unimaginable stateliness the knights,
clad in the blue and red robes of the Grail,
enter in solemn procession, and take their
seats at two semicircular tables which
start like arms to the right and left of
the holy shrine. Beneath it lies Titurel
entranced, and upon it is presently deposited
the sacred treasure of the Grail
itself.</p>

<p>As the wounded King Amfortas is
borne in, the assembled knights, each
standing in his place, a golden cup before
him, intone the Grail motive, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
taken up by the entering choruses of
servitors and esquires bearing the holy
relics.</p>

<p>Gurnemanz is seated among knights;
Parsifal stands aside and looks on in mute
astonishment, "a guileless one."</p>

<p>As the Holy Grail is set down on the
altar before the wounded king, a burst of
heavenly music streams from the high
dome&mdash;voices of angels intone the celestial
phrases, "<i>Take, eat</i>" and "<i>This is
my blood!</i>" and blend them with the
"faith and love" motives. As the choruses
die away, the voice of the entranced
Titurel is heard from beneath the altar
calling upon Amfortas, his son, to uncover
the Grail, that he may find refreshment
and life in the blessed vision.</p>

<p>Then follows a terrible struggle in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
breast of Amfortas. <i>He</i>, sore stricken in
sin, yet Guardian of the Grail, guilty
among the guiltless, oppressed with pain,
bowed down with shame, craving for
restoration, overwhelmed with unworthiness,
yet chosen to stand and minister
before the Lord on behalf of His saints!
Pathetic situation, which must in all times
repeat itself in the history of the Church.
The unworthiness of the minister affects
not the validity of his consecrated acts.
Yet what agony of mind must many a
priest have suffered, himself oppressed
with sin and doubt, while dispensing the
means of grace, and acting as a minister
and steward of the mysteries!</p>

<p>The marvelous piece of self-analysis in
which the conscience-stricken king bewails
his lot as little admits of description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
here as the music which embodies his
emotion.</p>

<p>At the close of it angel voices seem
floating in midair, sighing the mystic
words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Durch Mitleid wissend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Der reine Thor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harre sein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Den ich erkor."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Wait for my chosen one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guileless and innocent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity-enlightened.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And immediately afterward the voice of
Titurel, like one turning restlessly in his
sleep, comes up from his living tomb beneath
the altar: "<i>Uncover the Grail!</i>"</p>

<p>With trembling hands the sick king
raises himself, and with a great effort
staggers toward the shrine&mdash;the covering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
is removed&mdash;he takes the crystal cup&mdash;he
raises it on high&mdash;the blood is dark&mdash;the
light begins to fade in the hall&mdash;a mist
and dimness come over the scene&mdash;we
seem to be assisting at a shadowy ceremony
in a dream&mdash;the big bells are tolling&mdash;the
heavenly choirs from above the
dome, which is now bathed in twilight,
are heard: "<i>Drink ye all of this!</i>"
Amfortas raises on high the crystal vase&mdash;the
knights fall on their knees in prayer.
Suddenly a faint tremor of light quivers
in the crystal cup&mdash;then the blood grows
ruby red for a moment. Amfortas waves
it to and fro&mdash;the knights gaze in ecstatic
adoration. Titurel's voice gathers
strength in his tomb:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Celestial rapture:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How streams the light upon the face of God!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The light fades slowly out of the crystal
cup&mdash;the miracle is accomplished. The
blood again grows dark&mdash;the light of
common day returns to the halls of Montsalvat,
and the knights resume their seats,
to find each one his golden goblet filled
with wine.</p>

<p>During the sacred repast which follows,
the brotherhood join hands and embrace,
singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blessed are they that believe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed are they that love!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the refrain is heard again far up in
the heights, reechoed by the angelic
hosts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="caption">Copyright, 1903, by Pach Bros., N. Y.</p>
<p class="caption">THE GREAT HALL OF THE HOLY GRAIL</p>
</div>

<p><br /><br />I looked round upon the silent audience
while these astonishing scenes were passing
before me; the whole assembly was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
motionless&mdash;all seemed to be awed by
the august spectacle&mdash;seemed almost to
share in the devout contemplation and
trancelike worship of the holy knights.
Every thought of the stage had vanished&mdash;nothing
was further from my own
thoughts than play-acting. I was sitting
as I should sit at an oratorio, in devout
and rapt contemplation. Before my eyes
had passed a symbolic vision of prayer
and ecstasy, flooding the soul with overpowering
thoughts of the divine sacrifice
and the mystery of unfathomable love.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The hall of Montsalvat empties. Gurnemanz
strides excitedly up to Parsifal,
who stands stupefied with what he has
seen&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why standest thou silent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowest thou what thine eyes have seen?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The "guileless one" shakes his head.
"Nothing but a fool!" exclaims Gurnemanz,
angrily; and, seizing Parsifal by
the shoulder, he pushes him roughly out
of the hall, with:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be off! look after thy geese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And henceforth leave our swans in peace."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Grail vision had, then, taught the
"guileless one" nothing. He could not
see his mission&mdash;he was as yet unawakened
to the deeper life of the spirit; tho
blameless and unsullied, he was still the
"natural man." Profound truth! that
was not first which was spiritual, but that
which was natural; before Parsifal wins
a spiritual triumph, he must be spiritually
tried; his inner life must be deepened and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
developed, else he can never read aright
the messege of the Grail.</p>

<p>The life of God in the spirit comes
only when the battle for God in the heart
has been fought and won.</p>

<p>Fare forth, thou guileless one! thou
shalt yet add to the simplicity of the
dove the wisdom of the serpent. Thou
art innocent because ignorant; but thou
shalt be weighed anon in the balance
and not be found wanting; and then
shalt thou reconquer the holy spear lost
in Sin, rewon in Purity and Sacrifice, and
be to the frail Amfortas the chosen savior
for whom he waits.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The foregoing events occupied about an
hour and a quarter. When the curtain
fell the vast audience broke up in silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The air outside was cool and balmy.
In the distance lay the city of Bayreuth,
with the tower of the Alte Schloss and
the old church standing up gray against
the distant Bavarian hills. All around
us lay the pine woods, broken by the
lawns and avenues that encircle the theater
and embower it in a secluded world
of its own&mdash;even as the Palace of the
Grail was shut off from the profane
world. Here, indeed, is truly the Montsalvat
of the modern drama&mdash;a spot purified
and sacred to the highest aims and
noblest manifestations of Art.</p>

<p>In about an hour the Spear motive was
the signal blown on the wind instruments
outside, and I took my seat for the second
act.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Act_II" id="Act_II"></a>Act II</h2>


<p>A restless, passion-tossed prelude.
The "Grail" subject distorted,
the "Spear" motive thrust in
discordant, the "Faith and Love"
theme fluttering like a wounded dove in
pain, fierce bursts of passion, wild shocks
of uncontrolled misery, mingling with
the "carnal joy" music of Klingsor's
magic garden and the shuddering might
of his alchemy.</p>

<p>The great magician, Klingsor, is seen
alone in his dungeon palace&mdash;harsh contrast
to the gorgeous halls of Montsalvat.
Here all is built of the live rock, an im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>penetrable
fastness, the home of devilish
might and terrible spells.</p>

<p>Klingsor is aware of the coming struggle,
and he means to be ready for it. He
owns the sacred spear wrested from Amfortis;
he even aspires to win the Grail;
he knows the "guileless one" is on his
way to wrest that spear from him. His
only hope is in paralyzing the fool by
his enchantments as he paralyzed Amfortis,
and the same woman will serve his
turn.</p>

<p>"Kundry!" The time is come, the
spells are woven&mdash;blue vapors rise, and
in the midst of the blue vapors the figure
of the still sleeping Kundry is seen. She
wakes, trembling violently; she knows
she is again under the spell she abhors&mdash;the
spell to do evil, the mission to cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>rupt.
With a shuddering scream she
stands before her tormentor, denying his
power, loathing to return to her vile mission,
yet returning, as with a bitter cry
she vanishes from his presence.</p>

<p>Parsifal has invaded Klingsor's realm;
the evil knights have fled before his
prowess, wounded and in disorder.
Kundry is commissioned to meet the
guileless youth in the enchanted garden,
and, all other allurements failing, to subdue
him by her irresistible fascinations
and hand him over to Klingsor.</p>

<p>In a moment the scenery lifts, and a
garden of marvelous beauty and extent
lies before us. The flowers are all of colossal
dimensions&mdash;huge roses hang in
tangled festoons, the cactus, the lily, the
blue-bell, creepers, and orchids of enor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>mous
size and dazzling color wave in midair,
and climb the aromatic trees.</p>

<p>On a bright hill appears Parsifal,
standing bewildered by the light and
loveliness around him. Beautiful girls
dressed like flowers, and hardly distinguishable
from them at first, rush in, bewailing
their wounded and disabled
knights, but, on seeing Parsifal, fall upon
their new prey, and, surrounding him,
sing verse after verse of the loveliest ballet
music, while trying to embrace him,
and quarreling with each other for the
privilege.</p>

<p>About that wonderful chorus of flower-girls
there was just a suggestive touch
of the Rhine maidens' singing. It belonged
to the same school of thought and
feeling, but was freer, wilder&mdash;more con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>siderable,
and altogether more complex
and wonderful in its changes and in the
marvelous confusion in which it breaks
up.</p>

<p>The "guileless one" resists these
charmers, and they are just about to leave
him in disgust, when the roses lift on one
side, and, stretched on a mossy bank overhung
with flowers, appears a woman
of unearthly loveliness. It is Kundry
transformed, and in the marvelous duet
which follows between her and Parsifal,
a perfectly new and original type of love
duet is struck out&mdash;an analysis of character,
unique in musical drama&mdash;a combination
of sentiment and a situation absolutely
novel, which could only have
been conceived and carried out by a creative
genius of the highest order.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>First, I note that the once spellbound
Kundry is devoted utterly to her task of
winning Parsifal. Into this she throws
all the intensity of her wild and desperate
nature; but in turn she is strangely affected
by the spiritual atmosphere of the
"guileless one"&mdash;a feeling comes over
her, in the midst of her witchcraft passion,
that he is in some way to be her
savior too; yet, womanlike, she conceives
of her salvation as possible only in
union with him. Yet was this the very
crime to which Klingsor would drive her
for the ruin of Parsifal. Strange confusion
of thought, feeling, aspiration, longing&mdash;struggle
of irreconcilable elements!
How shall she reconcile them? Her intuition
fails her not, and her tact triumphs.
She will win by stealing his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
love through his mother's love. A mother's
love is holy; that love she tells him
of. It can never more be his; but she
will replace it, her passion shall be sanctified
by it; through <i>that</i> passion she has
sinned, through it she, too, shall be redeemed.
She will work out her own
salvation by the very spells that are upon
her for evil. He is pure&mdash;he shall make
her pure, can she but win him; both, by
the might of such pure love, will surely
be delivered from Klingsor, the corrupter,
the tormentor. Fatuous dream! How,
through corruption, win incorruption?
How, through indulgence, win peace and
freedom from desire? It is the old cheat
of the senses&mdash;Satan appears as an angel
of light. The thought deludes the unhappy
Kundry herself; she is no longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
consciously working for Klingsor; she
really believes that this new turn, this
bias given to passion, will purify both
her and the guileless, pure fool she seeks
to subdue.</p>

<p>Nothing can describe the subtlety of
their long interview, the surprising turns
of sentiment and contrasts of feeling.
Throughout this scene Parsifal's instinct
is absolutely true and sure. Everything
Kundry says about his mother, Herzeleide,
he feels; but every attempt to
make him accept her instead he resists.
Her desperate declamation is splendid.
Her heartrending sense of misery and
piteous prayer for salvation, her belief
that before her is her savior could she
but win him to her will, the choking fury
of baffled passion, the steady and subtle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
encroachments made while Parsifal is lost
in a meditative dream, the burning kiss
which recalls him to himself, the fine
touch by which this kiss, while arousing
in him the stormiest feelings, causes a
sharp pain, as of Amfortas's own wound,
piercing his very heart&mdash;all this is realistic,
if you will, but it is realism raised to
the sublime.</p>

<p>Suddenly Parsifal springs up, hurls the
enchantress from him, will forth from
Klingsor's realm. She is baffled&mdash;she
knows it; for a moment she bars his passage,
then succumbs; the might of sensuality
which lost Amfortas the sacred
spear has been met and defeated by the
guileless fool. He has passed from innocence
to knowledge in his interview with
the flower-girt girls, in his long converse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
with Kundry, in her insidious embrace,
in her kiss; but all these are now thrust
aside; he steps forth still unconquered,
still "guileless," but no more "a fool."
The knowledge of good and evil has
come, but the struggle is already passed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sinner, I do offer thee Redemption,"
he can say to Kundry; "not in thy
way, but in thy Lord Christ's way of
sacrifice!"</p>

<p>But the desperate creature, wild with
passion, will listen to no reason; she
shouts aloud to her master, and Klingsor
suddenly appears, poising the sacred
spear. In another moment he hurls it
right across the enchanted garden at
Parsifal. It can not wound the guileless
and pure one as it wounded the sinful
Amfortas. A miracle! It hangs ar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>rested
in air above Parsifal's head; he
seizes it&mdash;it is the sacred talisman, one
touch of which will heal even as it inflicted
the king's deadly wound.</p>

<p>With a mighty cry and the shock as of
an earthquake, the castle of Klingsor
falls shattered to pieces, the garden
withers up to a desert, the girls, who
have rushed in, lie about among the fading
flowers, themselves withered up and
dead. Kundry sinks down in a deathly
swoon, while Parsifal steps over a ruined
wall and disappears, saluting her with
the words: "Thou alone knowest when
we shall meet again!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The long shadows were stealing over
the hills when I came out at the second
pause. Those whom I met and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>versed
with were subdued and awed.
What a solemn tragedy of human passion
we had been assisting at! Not a heart
there but could interpret that struggle
between the flesh and the spirit from its
own experiences. Not one but knew the
desperately wicked and deceitful temptations
that come like enchantresses in the
wizard's garden, to plead the cause of
the devil in the language of high-flown
sentiment or even religious feeling.</p>

<p>Praise and criticism seemed dumb; we
rather walked and spoke of what we had
just witnessed like men convinced of
judgment, and righteousness, and sin. It
was a strange mood in which to come out
of a theater after witnessing what would
commonly be called an "Opera." I felt
more than ever the impossibility of pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ducing
the <i>Parsifal</i> in London, at Drury
Lane or Covent Garden, before a well-dressed
company of loungers, who had
well dined, and were on their way to
balls and suppers afterward.</p>

<p>I would as soon see the Oberammergau
play at a music-hall.</p>

<p>No; in <i>Parsifal</i> all is solemn, or all is
irreverent. At Bayreuth we came on a
pilgrimage; it cost us time, and trouble,
and money; we were in earnest&mdash;so were
the actors; the spirit of the great master
who had planned every detail seemed
still to preside over all; the actors lived
in their parts; not a thought of self remained;
no one accepted applause or
recall; no one aimed at producing a personal
effect; the actors were lost in the
drama, and it was the drama and not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
actors which has impressed and solemnized
us. When I came out they asked
me who was Amfortas? I did not know.
I said "the wounded king."</p>

<p>As the instruments played out the
Faith and Love motive for us to reenter,
the mellow sunshine broke once more
from the cloud-rack over city, and field,
and forest, before sinking behind the
long low range of the distant hills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Act_III" id="Act_III"></a>Act III</h2>


<p>The opening prelude of the third
and last act seems to warn me
of the lapse of time. The music
is full of pain and restlessness&mdash;the
pain of wretched years of long waiting
for a deliverer, who comes not; the restlessness
and misery of a hope deferred,
the weariness of life without a single joy.
The motives, discolored as it were by
grief, work up to a distorted version of
the Grail subject, which breaks off as
with a cry of despair.</p>

<p>Is the Grail, too, then turned into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
mocking spirit to the unhappy Amfortas?</p>

<p>Relief comes to us with the lovely scene
upon which the curtain rises. Again the
wide summer-land lies stretching away
over sunlit moor and woodland. In the
foreground wave the forest trees, and I
hear the ripple of the woodland streams.
Invariably throughout the drama, in the
midst of all human pain and passion,
great Nature is there, peaceful, harmonious
in all her loveliest moods, a paradise
in which dwell souls who make of her
their own purgatory.</p>

<p>In yonder aged figure, clad in the Grail
pilgrim robe, I discern Gurnemanz; his
hair is white; he stoops with years; a
rude hut is hard by. Presently a groan
arrests his attention, moaning as of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
human thing in distress. He clears away
some brushwood, and beneath it finds,
waking from her long trance, the strange
figure of Kundry. For how many years
she has slept we know not. Why is she
now recalled to life? She staggers to
her feet; we see that she too is in a pilgrim
garb, with a rope girding her dress
of coarse brown serge. "Service! service!"
she mutters, and, seizing a pitcher,
moves mechanically to fill it at the well,
then totters but half awake into the
wooden hut. The forest music breaks
forth&mdash;the hum of happy insect life, the
song of wild birds. All seems to pass
as in a vision, when suddenly enters a
knight clad in black armor from top to
toe.</p>

<p>The two eye him curiously, and Gur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>nemanz,
approaching, bids him lay aside
his armor and his weapons. He carries
a long spear. In silence the knight un-helms,
and, sticking the spear into the
ground, kneels before it, and remains
lost in devotional contemplation. The
"Spear" and "Grail" motives mingle
together in the full tide of orchestral
sounds carrying on the emotional undercurrent
of the drama. The knight is
soon recognized by both as the long-lost
and discarded Parsifal.</p>

<p>The "guileless one" has learned wisdom,
and discovered his mission&mdash;he
knows now that he bears the spear which
is to heal the king's grievous wound, and
that he himself is appointed his successor.
Through long strife and trial and
pain he seems to have grown into some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>thing
of Christ's own likeness. Not all
at once, but at last he has found the path.
He returns to bear salvation and pardon
both to Kundry and the wretched king,
Amfortas.</p>

<p>The full music flows on while Gurnemanz
relates how the knights have all
grown weak and aged, deprived of the
vision and sustenance of the Holy Grail,
while the long-entranced Titurel is at
last dead.</p>

<p>At this news Parsifal, overcome with
grief, swoons away, and Gurnemanz and
Kundry loosen his armor, and sprinkle
him with water from the holy spring.
Underneath his black suit of mail he appears
clad in a long white tunic.</p>

<p>The grouping here is admirable.
Gurnemanz is in the Templar's red and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
blue robe. Parsifal in white, his auburn
hair parted in front and flowing down in
ringlets on either side, recalls Leonardo's
favorite conception of the Savior's head,
and, indeed, from this point Parsifal becomes
a kind of symbolic reflection of the
Lord Himself. Kundry, subdued and
awed, lies weeping at his feet; he lifts
his hands to bless her with infinite pity.
She washes his feet, and dries them
with the hairs of her head. It is a bold
stroke, but the voices of nature, the
murmur of the summer woods, come
with an infinite healing tenderness and
pity, and the act is seen to be symbolical
of the pure devotion of a sinful creature
redeemed from sin. Peace has at last
entered into that wild and troubled heart,
and restless Kundry, delivered from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Klingsor's spell, receives the sprinkling of
baptismal water at the hands of Parsifal.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The great spaces of silence in the dialog,
broken now by a few sentences from
Parsifal, now from Gurnemanz, are more
eloquent than many words. The tidal
music flows on in a ceaseless stream of
changing harmonies, returning constantly
to the sweet and slumbrous sound of
a summer-land, full of teeming life and
glowing happiness.</p>

<p>Then Gurnemanz takes up his parable.
It is the Blessed Good Friday on which
our dear Lord suffered. The Love and
Faith phrases are chimed forth, the
pain-notes of the Cross agony are sounded
and pass, the Grail motive seems to
swoon away in descending harmonies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
sinking into the woodland voices of universal
Nature&mdash;that trespass-pardoned
Nature that now seems waking to the day
of her glory and innocence.</p>

<p>In that solemn moment Parsifal bends
over the subdued and humbled Kundry,
and kisses her softly on the brow&mdash;<i>her</i>
wild kiss in the garden had kindled in
him fierce fire, mingled with the bitter
wound-pain; <i>his</i> is the seal of her eternal
pardon and peace.</p>

<p>In the distance the great bells of Montsalvat
are now heard booming solemnly&mdash;the
air darkens, the light fades out, the
slow motion of all the scenery recommences.
Again I hear the wild cave
music, strange and hollow sounding&mdash;the
three move on as in a dream, and are
soon lost in the deep shadows; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
through all, louder and louder, boom the
heavy bells of Montsalvat, until the stage
brightens, and we find ourselves once
more in the vast Alhambralike hall of
the knights.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">PARSIFAL ENTERING THE GRAIL CASTLE IN TRIUMPH</p>
</div>

<p><br /><br />For the last time Amfortas is borne in,
and the brotherhood of the Grail form
the possession bearing the sacred relics,
which are deposited before him.</p>

<p>The king, in great agony and despair,
bewails the death of his father and his
own backsliding. With failing but desperate
energy he harangues the assembled
knights, and, tottering forward, beseeches
them to free him from his misery and sin-stained
life, and thrust their swords deep
into his wounded side. At this moment
Gurnemanz, accompanied by Parsifal and
Kundry, enter. Parsifal steps forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
with the sacred spear, now at length to
be restored to the knights. He touches
the side of Amfortas, the wound is healed,
and as he raises the spear on high the
point is seen glowing with the crimson
glory of the Grail. Then stepping up to
the shrine, Parsifal takes the crystal cup,
the dark blood glows bright crimson as
he holds it on high, and at that moment,
while all fall on their knees, and celestial
music ("Drink ye all of this") floats in
the upper air, Kundry falls back dying,
her eyes fixed on the blessed Grail. A
white dove descends and hovers for a moment,
poised in mid-air above the glowing
cup. A soft chorus of angels seems to
die away in the clouds beyond the golden
dome&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Victorious Savior!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Words can add nothing to the completeness
of the drama, and no words can give
any idea of the splendor and complexity
of that sound ocean upon which the
drama floats from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The enemies of the Grail are destroyed
or subdued, the wound they have inflicted
is healed, the prey they claimed is
rescued; the pure and blameless Parsifal
becomes the consecrated head of the holy
brotherhood, and the beatic vision of
God's eternal love and Real Presence is
restored to the knights of the Sangrail.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When I came out of the theater, at the
end of the third and last act, it was ten
o'clock.</p>

<p>The wind was stirring in the fir-trees,
the stars gleamed out fitfully through a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
sky, across which the clouds were hurrying
wildly, but the moon rose low and
large beyond the shadowy hills, and
bathed the misty valleys with a mild and
golden radiance as of some celestial dawn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="When_the_Curtain_Fell" id="When_the_Curtain_Fell"></a>When the Curtain Fell</h2>


<p>When the curtain fell on the last
performance of <i>Parsifal</i>, at Bayreuth,
which, on the 30th of
July, 1883, brought the celebration month
to a close, the enthusiasm of the audience
found full vent in applause. The curtain
was once lifted, but no calls would
induce the performers to appear a second
time or receive any individual homage.
This is entirely in accordance with the
tone of these exceptional representations.
On each occasion the only applause
permitted was at the end of the
drama, and throughout not a single actor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
answered to a call or received any personal
tribute.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes occurred a touching
incident. The banker Gross led Wagner's
children up to the assembled actors,
and in the name of their dead father
thanked the assembly for the care and
labor of love expended by each and all in
producing the last work of the great dead
master. Siegfried, Wagner's son, thirteen
years old, then, in a few simple
words, stifled with sobs, thanked the
actors personally, and all the children
shook hands with them. The King of
Bavaria charged himself upon Wagner's
death with the education of his son.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>THE TRANSFIGURATION
OF MISS PHILURA</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By FLORENCE MORSE KINGSLEY</span></p>

<p><i>Author of</i> "<i>Titus</i>," "<i>Prisoners of the Sea," etc</i>.</p>

<p>This clever story is based on the theory
that every physical need and every desire
of the human heart can be claimed and
received from the "Encircling Good" by
the true believer. Miss Philura is enchanted
with this creed, adopts it literally, and obtains
thereby various blessings of particular value
to a timid spinster, including a husband.</p>

the day when they came back to Mary,

<p>THE TROUBLE WOMAN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By CLARA MORRIS</span></p>

<p>A pathetic, even tragic tale, but one
which carries the most optimistic of

story is that the way to find consolation for
one's own trouble is to consider those of
others and to lend a helping hand.</p>
